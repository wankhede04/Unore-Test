# Sushiswap Masterchef

### Q. Can you prove the Sushiswap Masterchef logic mathematically?

The `pendingSushi` function calculates the pending amount of sushi that can be harvested by a user for a particular pool
2 main variables used to calculate the amount of sushi to transfer to a user are `accSushiPerShare` and `rewardDebt`.

`accSushiPerShare`: This value is the amount of sushi reward per share (example if total rewards till current block is 10 sushi and total deposited LP token is 100 then sushi reward per share is 1/10) from block 0.

`rewardDebt`: This value is the amount of sushi rewards that user has already harvested or user is not available for since during that period user does not have any staked LP tokens.

Lets take a example to explain the accSushiPerShare and rewardDebt calculation

    RewardsPerBlock = 10 sushi
    On block 0, user A deposits 200 LP tokens
    On block 10, user B deposits 800 LP tokens
    On block 20, user A harvests all rewards generated
    On block 30, user B harvests all rewards generated
    On block 50, both users A and B harvests all rewards.

    UserATotalRewards = UserARewardBlock0-10 + UserARewardBlock10-20 + UserARewardBlock20-50

    Since UserARewardBlockX-Y = UserALPShareX-Y * BlockRewardsX-Y
    So above equation can be written as

    UserATotalRewards = (UserALPShare0-10 * BlockRewards0-10) + (UserALPShare10-20 * BlockRewards10-20) + (UserALPShare20-30 * BlockRewards20-30) + (UserALPShare30-50 * BlockRewards30-50)

    UserAShareX-Y = UserALPTokenDepositedX-Y / TotalLPTokenDepositedX-Y
    BlockRewardsX-Y = RewardsPerBlock * (Y -X)

    UserATotalRewards = ( (200 / 200) * (10 * 10) ) + ( (200 / 1000) * (10 * 10) ) + ( (200 / 1000) * (10 * 10) ) + ( (200 / 1000) * (10 * 20) )
    UserATotalRewards = 100 + 20 + 60 = 180 sushi

    Similarly for User B

    UserBTotalRewards = (UserBLPShare10-20 * BlockRewards10-20) + (UserBLPShare20-30 * BlockRewards20-30) + (UserBLPShare30-50 * BlockRewards30-50)
    UserBTotalRewards = ( (800 / 1000) * (10 * 10) ) + ( (800 / 1000) * (10 * 10) ) + ( (800 / 1000) * (10 * 20) )
    UserBTotalRewards = 80 + 80 + 160 = 320 sushi

    Now if we look at the above 2 equations for User A and B we can find that both have a common multiplier during each section of blocks from [10-20], [20-30], [30-50]
    These common values are [(1/1000) * (10 * 10)], [(1/1000) * (10 * 10)], [(1/1000) * (10 * 20)]

    At any given block sum of these values till that block is called in SushiSwap's term as "accSushiPerShare"
    Then to calculate rewards for any user we just need to multiply the staked LP tokens share of that user with the accSushiPerShare value.

    Since User A has constant deposit from block 0 to block 50 we can simply multiply by 200
    UserATotalRewards = 200 * ( (1/200) * (10 * 10) + (1/1000) * (10 * 10) + (1/1000) * (10 * 10) + (1/1000) * (10 * 20) )
    UserATotalRewards = 200 * ( 9 * (1/1000) * (10 * 10) )
    UserATotalRewards = 180

    for User B has constant deposit 0f 0 from block 0 to 10 and 800 from block 10 t0 50
    UserBTotalRewards = TotalRewardsBlock0-50 - RewardsBlock0-10
    UserBTotalRewards = 800 * ( (1/200) * (10 * 10) + (1/1000) * (10 * 10) + (1/1000) * (10 * 10) + (1/1000) * (10 * 20) ) - 800 * ( (1/200) * (10 * 10) )
    UserATotalRewards = 800 * ( 4 * (1/1000) * (10 * 10) )
    UserATotalRewards = 320 sushi

The rewards that we subtracted for User B is known as rewardDebt. It is the value denoting the amount of sushi rewards which has already been harvested(means collected) by the user or the rewards for which this user is not eligible because it did not have any staked LP tokens for that period.

#### `rewardDebt` for a user is updated if a user
i) deposit: Increasing `rewardDebt` such that the new staked tokens should not have share in the rewards generated till now.

ii) withdraw: Decreasing `rewardDebt` such that the tokens withdrawn should not have share in the rewards to be generated in future.

iii) harvest: Increasing `rewardDebt` such that `pendingSushi` after harvesting for currentBlock will be 0.

iv) withdrawAndHarvest: setting `rewardDebt` to value equal to `accumulatedSushi` till now from `allStakeLP` minus the `sushiGeneratedTillNow` from the amount of tokens to withdraw.


#### pool's `accSushiPerShare` value is updated when
i) A user directly calls the `massUpdatePools/updatePool` method with the pool id.

ii) Through deposit function when a user calls it to increase his staked LP tokens amount.

iii) Through withdraw function when a user wants to decrease his staked LP tokens amount.

iv) Through harvest function when a user wishes to collect his generated sushi rewards.

v) Thorugh `withdrawAndHarvest` fucntion when a user wants to both decrease his staked LP token amount and collect the generated sushi rewards.

Inside the updatePool function `accSushiPerShare` is only increased whwen the current block number is greater then the `lastRewardBlock`. if so diff in current block and `lastRewardBlock` is stored in blocks variable. `sushiReward` stores the current `sushiRewardPerBlock` for the given pool id based on this pool's allocation point.
Then the value generated by multiplying `sushiReward` by Accumulated Sushi Precision constant and dividing by `totalLPSupply` of pool is added to the current `accSushiPerShare` value, and last reward block for the pool is updated.
