# Uniswap ETH DAI

### Q. What function would you use to swap ETH for DAI on the uniswap V2 exchange? What would be the input parameters?

We have two functions to swap ETH for DAI on uniswap V2.

[swapExactETHForTokens](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L252):
This function allows you to specify exact amount of ETH you want to swap and the desired minimum amount of DAI you would like to receive in return.

Input parameter are as follows:
- uint256 amountOutMin: The minimum amount of output tokens (DAI) that must be received for the transaction not to revert.
    - To calculate this value, you can use this function [getAmountsOut](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L427) by providing the amount of ETH and path {0: WETH, 1: DAI} and add slippage in between 0.1% and 5%
    - This value is used to prevent front-running attack
- address[] path: This parameter is an array of token addresses representing the path the swap should take. In this case, the array would contain the addresses of WETH and DAI tokens. The order matters, so the array should start with the address of the WETH token (for ETH support) and end with the address of the DAI token. This method checks for path[0] == WETH address. Internally, ETH gets converted to WETH and then further swap occurs.
- address to: This parameter represents the recipient address where the swapped DAI tokens will be sent.
- uint256 deadline: This parameter is a timestamp representing the deadline for the swap. If the transaction is mined after this deadline, it will revert.

This function allows you to specify exact amount of DAI you would like to receive in return for the amount of ETH swapped.

Input parameter are as follows:
- amountOut: The amount of DAI tokens to receive.
    - To calculate amount of ETH required, you can use this function [getAmountsIn](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L437C14-L437C26). You will need to pass exact amount of DAI required, and path {0: WETH, 1: DAI}, and this function will returns the amount of ETH required, add slippage.
